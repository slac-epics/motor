           Build against asyn-trunk_Sept_17_2013

motor-R6-8-RC1_1-7-BR: Branch out from the motor-R6-8-RC1_1-7

07/09/2014
motor-R6-8-RC1_1-7:
           Modified XPSAxis.* to fix axis not showing moving state 
07/09/2014
motor-R6-8-RC1_1-6:
           Modified XPSAxis.* and XPSController.* with additional asyn parameters for XPS axis info
07/02/2014
motor-R6-8-RC1_1-5:
           Added axis queue monitoring to OmsAsyn omsBaseController poller task.  Flush axis queue
           if it goes below threshold.
           Added check before omsBaseAxis.cpp::move()  to check if servo, if so make sure clsoed loop
           is set.

motor-R6-8-RC1_1-4:
           Rearrange basicIoOps.h -don't need to include miscutils to build
           motorRecord.cc - updated jog near soft limits - use jvel not velo to determine overrun
           omsMAXv.cpp - flush multiple responses in sendOnly()
           omsBaseController.cpp - increase timeout while waiting for controller response
                                 - add wait prior to sending Init string - fixes boot config problems 
motor-R6-8-RC1_1-3:
02/28/2014 OmsAsynSrc: Adding miscUtils module for basicIoOps.h and removing local 
           copy of the header, modifying OmsAsynSrc/Makefile so it now compiles 
           with metods described in basicIoOps.h (Ziga Oven)
motor-R6-8-SLAC_merge:
02/06/2014 Merged motor versions from SPEAR and LCLS. This are the changes:

           From LCLS side:
           - Added SmartMotorAsynSrc for SmartMotor Class4 and Class5 (Mitch D'Ewart)
           - Added change in AerotechSrc, to move multiple motors (Mitch D'Ewart)
