To build any examples;

- in <motor>/configure/RELEASE: EPICS_BASE and MOTOR must be defined.

- in <motor>/Makefile: the following two lines must be uncommented;
  #DIRS := $(DIRS) $(filter-out $(DIRS), motorExApp)
  #DIRS := $(DIRS) $(filter-out $(DIRS), iocBoot)

To build the iocWithAsyn example;

- in <motor>/configure/RELEASE: IPAC and ASYN must be defined.
          
          
Finally, cd <motor>; gnumake clean uninstall; gnumake

To run this Newport MM4000/5, "asyn" example on a Unix OS;
- Set the EPICS_HOST_ARCH environment variable correctly.
- Edit the st.cmd.unix file for either sun or linux.
- Start the ioc from this directory by executing the following command.

../../bin/${EPICS_HOST_ARCH}/WithAsyn st.cmd.unix
