Configuring MDrive for party mode.
----------------------------------

The following is a modified version of the procedure defined in Section 2.1,
"Interfacing RS-485 Communications", page #25, of the "MDrive Motion Control"
manual; Revision 02.05.2004.

1. Connect the first MDrive Motion Control to the Host PC configured for Single
        Mode Operation.
	
2. Establish communications.
	If you can see the sign-on message "Copyright 2001-2003 by Intelligent
	Motion Systems, Inc.", then you are up and running.  If the sign-on
	message does not appear, try using a software reset.  Hold down the
	"Ctrl" key and press "C" (^C). If the sign-on message still does not
	appear then there may be a problem with either the connections,
	hardware or software configuration of the MDrive Motion Control or
	Host.

3. Using the command DN, name the MDrive Motion Control. This must be a number
        1-9. (DN="1"{enter}). Label the motor with the device name.

4. Set Echo Mode EM=1{enter}.

5. Set the party flag PY=1{enter}.

6. Type CTRL+J to activate the Party Mode.

7. Type {DN}S CTRL+J where {DN} is the device name given in step #3 (Save
        device name, Echo and Party Mode).

8. Remove power.

9. Repeat steps 1 through 8 for each additional MDrive in the system using
        successive device names "1" through "9".
