Configuring MDrive for party mode.
----------------------------------

The following is a modified version of the procedure defined in Section 2.1,
"Interfacing RS-485 Communications", page #25, of the "MDrive Motion Control"
manual; Revision 02.05.2004.

1. Configure the first MDrive Motion Control to the Host PC configured for Single
        Mode Operation.
	
2. Establish communications.
	If you can see the sign-on message "Copyright 2001-2003 by Intelligent
	Motion Systems, Inc.", then you are up and running.  If the sign-on
	message does not appear, try using a software reset.  Hold down the
	"Ctrl" key and press "C" (^C). If the sign-on message still does not
	appear then there may be a problem with either the connections,
	hardware or software configuration of the MDrive Motion Control or
	Host.

3. Using the command DN, name the MDrive Motion Control. This must be a number
        1-9. (DN="1"{enter}). Label the motor with the device name.

4. Set Echo Mode EM=1{enter}.

5. Set the party flag PY=1{enter}.

6. Type CTRL+J to activate the Party Mode.

7. Type {DN}S CTRL+J where {DN} is the device name given in step #3 (Save
        device name, Echo and Party Mode).

8. Remove power.

9. Repeat steps 1 through 8 for each additional MDrive in the system using
        successive device names "1" through "9".

Configuring IM483's for Party Mode communication.
------------------------------------------------

The following is a modified version of the procedure defined in the
"Communication" section, page #9, of the "Software Reference Manual"; Revision
051794.

1) Power down the IM483's.  Configure each IM483 module for stand alone (single
mode) communications.  For the APS Diviero chassis, jumper J4 for Stand Alone
(1-2) and J7 for Master (1-2).

2) Connect an RS-232 serial connection (9600,none,8,1) from a host terminal to
the first ("A") controller's front panel connector.

3) Power up the IM483.

4) Assign the axis name.  At the host terminal, enter the letter "A" (0x41)
followed by a space charter (0x20).

5) The IM483 controller should respond by echoing the "A" character and the
sign-on message at the host terminal, i.e.,

A   1342     4038 ADVANCED MICRO SYSTEMS, INC
MAX-2000 v1.15i

6) Change the "Limit Polarity" to active high.  At the host terminal, enter
"l1<enter>".  The IM483 should echo your input at the host terminal.

7) Store parameters.  At the  host  terminal, enter "S<enter>".

8) Move RS-232 connection to next controller.  At the host terminal, enter
control c (^c).  Repeat steps 4 through 7 while incrementing the axis name
(i.e, A, B, C, etc.).

9) Set all the IM483's for Party Mode communication.  For the APS Diviero
chassis, configure all of the IM483's for Party Mode by setting J4 to (2-3).
Connect the RS-232 port to the Master IM483 and set all the remaining IM483's
to Slave mode by setting J7 to (2-3).
